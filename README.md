This project is review for the backend course module I completed with Digital Career Institute (DCI). 

I built a rest API for a Customer Relationship Management tool for an imaginary solar PV energy company based in Germany.
The server is set up using ExpressJS.
The http request routes are connected with a MongoDB database.

Routes enable the following CRUD operations
-Create a contact
-Read a list of all contacts
-Read a list of select contacts
-Update contacts
-Delete contacts
